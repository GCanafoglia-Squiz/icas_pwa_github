        <!--<p>Alice Telfer, Head of Business Policy &amp; Public Sector at ICAS tells us what it’s all about.</p>-->
        <!--<h3><strong>Q: Why have you produced this guide?</strong></h3>-->
        <!--<p>We are increasingly applying principles-based standards. Making a judgement in a complex world, with-->
        <!--principles-based accounting standards is not an easy task, but the success of narrative and financial reporting-->
        <!--relies on our ability to be able to make sound judgements and to demonstrate our reasoning for making these-->
        <!--judgements.</p>-->
        <!--<h3><strong>Q: ICAS produced a similar guide in 2012, what is new in this guide?</strong></h3>-->
        <!--<p>We have updated the guide to include a new section for decision making by audit committees to complete the loop-->
        <!--on financial reporting.&nbsp;&nbsp;It aims to help audit committee members to challenge and assess the-->
        <!--information and opinions provided by both management and auditors</p>-->
        <!--<p>The guide has also been refreshed to make it more user friendly for online readers.</p>-->
        <!--<p><strong> </strong></p>-->
        <!--<h3><strong>Q: What is the purpose of the guide?</strong></h3>-->
        <!--<p>It offers practical guidance for decision makers involved in narrative and financial reporting.</p>-->
        <!--<p>The guide provides a structure to help you come to a sound judgement when you have a complex financial or-->
        <!--narrative reporting decision to make.</p>-->
        <!--<p><img src="https://icas.com/__data/assets/image/0010/285778/shutterstock_187318379.jpg"-->
        <!--alt="Pensive businesswoman"></p>-->
        <!--<h3><strong>Q: Who is it for?</strong></h3>-->
        <!--<p>It can be used by accountants and non-accountants, whether in the private or not-for profit sectors, irrespective-->
        <!--of the size and type of organisation.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is relevant at an international level and is promoted by-->
        <!--IFAC (the International Federation of Accountants).</p>-->
        <!--<p>It is targeted at preparers, auditors, audit committee members and regulators.</p>-->
        <!--<h3><strong>Q: Is it useful for those new to making professional judgements?</strong></h3>-->
        <!--<p>Yes, the guide can provide a useful training guide for students or those new to decision making who wish to share-->
        <!--the experience of those who have been there and done it before. It also enables individuals to recognise-->
        <!--situations where they need to seek assistance from others.</p>-->
        <!--<h3><strong>Q: What does the framework do?</strong></h3>-->
        <!--<p>It identifies core principles and provides a structured process to guide the key decision makers in financial and-->
        <!--narrative reporting.</p>-->
        <!--<p>This framework supports each part of the process from preparers making and documenting the judgement, auditors-->
        <!--assessing and challenging, audit committees reviewing and concluding on the judgement as well as assisting-->
        <!--regulators, understanding why key judgements have been made and in assessing whether judgements were appropriate-->
        <!--given the facts available at the time.</p>-->
        <!--<h3><strong>Q: What else does it include?</strong></h3>-->
        <!--<p>ICAS firmly believes that a principles-based approach to standard setting is a key driver of quality reporting.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our-->
        <!--guide therefore also includes recommendations for standard setters to ensure that standards provide the scope-->
        <!--for professional judgement.</p>-->

                By Gillian Donaldson, Senior Financial Recruiter, Rutherford Cross <br />
                29 March 2019
            </p>

        <h2>Now that you've finally qualified, you may be wondering what's next. Gillian Donaldson at Rutherford Cross
            shares her top tips for newly-qualified professionals.</h2>
        <p>The effort and determination required to become a qualified chartered accountant are considerable, and
            newly-qualified professionals should be congratulated on their achievements. However, the reality is that
            for these newly-qualified accountants, the hard work is far from over.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">Many of those who get into the accountancy profession do so with clear career
            ambitions; to make partner at one of the accountancy firms, or land the role of CFO for a SME or global
            business, perhaps. What is sometimes not so clear is exactly how to get there.</p>
        <p>Many young accountants are full of ambition, but not quite clear on the path they should follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;Think
            strategically about your career goals. Researching the career paths of others who have gone before, building
            professional networks, and working to understand what a business needs from its future finance leaders. At
            Rutherford Cross, we work closely with accountancy firms and businesses to help them source their ideal
            candidates. As such, we are privileged to have a good understanding of what these business need, and too,
            what skills the accountants of the future need to be successful.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">Below we discuss some of the key things accountants can do throughout their
            careers to ensure that they are on track to achieve their career aspirations.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Define your goal</strong></h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify">Success requires focus, and focus requires a set goal. What does success look like
            to you? Once you have done your research and defined your goal, understand that achieving it will require
            hard work and an element of sacrifice.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">Take time to reflect on this and build in time to do so as you progress in your
            career, ensuring that the goal you set yourself at the beginning still motivates and inspires you.</p>
        <h2><strong>Work with a mentor </strong></h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify">Having a mentor who can advise and assure you as you work your way up the career
            ladder is invaluable. Your mentor may be your manager, a more experienced colleague, or someone you connect
            with via a course such as the <a href="https://www.icas.com/professional-development/mentoring-and-career-support" target="_blank" title="ICAS Career Mentoring">ICAS Career Mentoring Programme.</a> This virtual programme matches
            mentees and mentors from a global network of CAs, based on their experience and requirements and you can
            register your interest in the programme now.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">Your mentor can share their own experiences, support you to fill your skill gaps
            and advise you on decisions that will impact on your future career.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">Also, don’t overlook building a trusted relationship with a selected specialist
            finance recruiter. They will be constantly interacting with professionals who you are aspiring to emulate
            and understand how successful careers build and develop. As a minimum, they should provide a good sounding
            board on live market trends and career options.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Network</strong></h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify">Building a strong network of peers, senior colleagues, and advisors can be hugely
            beneficial to your career progression. Sharing experiences and challenges can help you shape your career
            journey, and may also open doors to new career opportunities. The networks available via professional
            accounting bodies such as ICAS are amongst the strongest in the world and newly-qualified accountants should
            make the most of them by attending relevant events and staying abreast of global industry news and
            opportunities.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">As touched upon earlier, advisors, such as specialist recruiters, can give you an
            insight into what others have done to achieve their goals, we also can help widen your peer network. Check
            for resources within your firm which are designed to help you plan your career and make the most of your
            network.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Be open to opportunity</strong></h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify">The path you think leads straight to the top may not be the one that ends up
            getting you to your goal. There are many ambitious professionals out there set on climbing to the top, so
            start thinking about how you can differentiate yourself and build your personal brand.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">Initially, positioning yourself as ‘front of mind’ with your managers through
            volunteering for projects and going beyond expectations can lead to promotion and recognition. However,
            showing your commitment and expanding your experience by taking secondments with different teams across your
            business, or taking an international posting can really give your career a boost.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">Taking a ‘sideways step’ into another function or business can seem like a
            distraction from your end goal, but in reality, it could help to make you a more rounded and experienced
            professional.</p>
